# 🌸 Simple Omelette Recipe Card — Pastel Edition  

This is my solution to the **Frontend Mentor – Recipe Page challenge**, recreated in a soft pastel theme to match my personal style!  
I rebuilt the layout using **HTML, CSS**, and a **React version** for fun, practicing structure, responsive design, and custom theming.

## ✨ Overview

### 📌 The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the recipe card layout on desktop & mobile  
- See clear section divisions (ingredients, preparation, instructions, nutrition)  
- Read clean, accessible typography  
- Enjoy a cohesive theme and responsive structure  

---

## 🌿 My Approach  

I took the base FEM design and added my own aesthetic:

- 🎀 **Pastel pink color palette** with CSS custom properties  
- 🍥 **Soft pink borders** for subtle visual separation  
- 🍓 **Pretty accent colors** for headings and highlights  
- 📐 **Fully responsive image + layout**  
- 📦 **Custom list markers + branded UI elements**  
- 🌸 **A cute theme that feels playful, warm, and inherently me!**

All while maintaining the original FEM structure and requirements.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**  
- **Custom CSS (no frameworks)**  
- **CSS Variables + Box Model + Flexbox**  
- **Media Queries for responsiveness**  
- **React + Vite**  

---

## 🎨 Features & Styling Choices

- **Pastel UI theme** inspired by soft notebook aesthetics  
- **Custom borders** around the preparation section  
- **Pink-themed nutrition table**  
- **Hand-chosen accent shades** for headings + markers  
- **Improved readability** via spacing + line-height tweaks  
- **Smooth scaling image** with rounded corners

## 📱 Responsive Design  

The layout adapts across breakpoints:

- Desktop (740px max card width)  
- Tablet  
- Small mobile screens (320px-425px)  
---

## 🚀 What I Learned

- The importance of **fluid responsiveness** instead of hard width overrides  
- How to use **CSS variables** for clean theming  
- Structuring nutrition data using `<ul>` with `flex` instead of HTML tables (which I had done at first 😭)
- Improving readability with subtle theming  
- That UI is pastel-centric and cute, which I adored making! 🩷🌸
